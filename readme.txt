Rules
There are many varieties of Seega, but we are only including instructions for one of the most common, basic games.

A board of 5 x 5 squares is marked out and each player has twelve distinctive 'stones'. Rocks and potsherds work nicely. 
The board may be increased to 7 x 7 or 9 x 9, each player then having twenty-four or forty pieces.

Object of the Game 
Similar to checkers, you are trying to capture your opponent's pieces. The game ends when a player (the looser) has only one piece left.

Start (Optional in Kharga)
To start, the first player lays down two of his or her pieces in the squares marked "X." The other player lays down two pieces
in the squares marked "O."

Next, the players take turns, laying down two pieces at a time in any square but the center square.
These turns are taken until all the pieces are laid down. The center square is left open.

Moving Pieces 
Pieces may be moved only to adjacent open squares, but diagonal moves are not allowed.

Taking Pieces 
A piece is taken (removed from the board) when it is "sandwiched" by two of the opponent's pieces. Sandwiching diagonally does not count. 
"Pieces are only taken when the opponent makes a move that sandwiches the piece. For example, if you move your piece in between two of your
opponent's pieces your piece is safe. If in the original layout of the board, one of your pieces is between two of your opponent's pieces, 
your piece is safe. 

In the diagram, when the red stone is moved as shown, it captures all three blue stones simultaneously.


After making a capture a player can continue to move the same stone as long as it makes further captures.
Safe ground: a player can safely move a stone between two enemy stones and a stone on the central square cannot be captured.
When a player cannot move the opponent must make an entry by taking an extra turn.



The winner: a player wins outright if he can capture all the enemy stones.

Each player may make a barrier behind which there are only his own pieces and these can be moved without fear of attack. The initial placing of the stones is important in planning such a barrier or in preventing the other player from making one. If a barrier is set up, then the player with most stones on the board wins. If they have the same number of stones on the board the game is drawn.




Other Rules 
If a player is completely blocked in so that he or she cannot make any moves, then the blocked-in player is allowed to remove any one of 
the opponent's pieces to clear a path. This situation usually arises only within the first few moves of the game.

A second move in a single turn is allowed if the first move yielded a "take" and an additional move of the same piece will yield another "take."
If a whole series of such moves are possible, then several moves in the same turn are allowed.

FEN for Kharbga  -- 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth–Edwards_Notation

Adapted for Kharbga


Definition[edit]
A FEN "record" defines a particular game position, all in one text line and using only the ASCII character set. 
A text file with only FEN data records should have the file extension ".fen".[1]

A FEN record contains six fields. The separator between fields is a space. The fields are:

- Piece placement (from white's perspective). 
- Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1; 
- within each rank, the contents of each square are described from file "a" through file "g". 
- Following the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is identified by a single letter taken 
- from the standard English names (solider = "S").
- [1] White/Attacker pieces are designated using upper-case letters ("S") or A 
- while black/Defender pieces use lowercase ("s"). Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 7 (the number of empty squares), and "/" separates ranks.

- Active color. "w" means White/Attacker moves next, "b" means Black / Defender.

- 
Castling availability. If neither side can castle, this is "-". Otherwise, this has one or more letters: "K" (White can castle kingside), "Q" (White can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle kingside), and/or "q" (Black can castle queenside).
En passant target square in algebraic notation. If there's no en passant target square, this is "-". If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn. This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture.[2]
Halfmove clock: This is the number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance. This is used to determine if a draw can be claimed under the fifty-move rule.
Fullmove number: The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is incremented after Black's move.
Examples[edit]
Here is the FEN for the starting position:

7/7/7/7/7/7/7  w    -- No pieces on the board

Seega is a small battle game played in Egypt in the 19th and 20th centuries. Two players drop pieces onto a board, 
leaving only the central square empty, after which pieces are moved around the board from one square to the next. 
Pieces are captured by surrounding them on opposite sides, and the player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins the game.

History of Seega

Egypt was a source of many interesting games in ancient times, but its inventiveness has continued into the modern age. 
The game of seega was apparently unknown in the 17th century, but became popular in the early 19th century, 
only to decline in its homeland late in the 20th.

The game was more a pastime of the poor than the rich. Boards were scratched into the temple stones at Kurna, 
but they appear to be relatively recent and of poor quality. The game was more usually played with pebbles on a 
lattice scratched into the ground.

The game is especially interesting as it resembles games played in ancient Greece and Rome, petteia and latrunculi. 
The Greeks claimed that petteia came from Egypt, and it would be tempting to think that this game of seega is 
the one the Greeks adopted, but there is very little evidence to support this. It is therefore possible that 
the resemblance is entirely coincidental.

Rules for Seega



Rules for Seega
There are some variations in different countries, but the rules that follow are a fair summary.
1. Seega is played on a board of 5 squares by 5, the central square of which is marked with a pattern, 
as shown in the diagram. The board starts empty, and each player starts with 12 pieces of his own colour in hand.

2. Players decide at random who begins.

3. Players take turns to place 2 pieces each anywhere on the board, except for the central square.

4. When all pieces are placed, the second player begins the movement phase. Moving the Pieces

5. A piece may move one square in any horizontal or vertical direction. Diagonal moves are not allowed.

6. In this phase pieces may move onto the central square.

7. If a player is unable to move, his opponent must take an extra turn and create an opening.

8. If a player in his move traps an enemy piece between two of his own, the enemy is captured and removed from the board. 
Diagonal entrapment does not count here.

9. After moving a piece to capture an enemy, the player may continue to move the same piece while 
it can make further captures.

10. If, when moving a piece, two or three enemies become simultaneously trapped, then all these 
trapped enemies are captured and removed from the board.

11. It is permissible to move a piece between two enemies without its being harmed. One of the enemies 
must move away and back again to effect a capture.

12. A piece on the central square is immune from capture, but may itself be used to capture enemy pieces.

13. The game is won by the player who has captured all his enemy's pieces.

The game is often played on a 7×7 board with 24 pieces for each player, and on a 9×9 board with 40 pieces each.

Some writers have noted that it is possible to force a draw by creating a straight, impenetrable barrier 
of pieces with no enemies behind. To prevent this, players may agree beforehand that such a situation gives 
victory to the player with the most pieces remaining on the board at the end of the game.
