                                    <li>Each player uses 24 pieces of different colors representing their soldiers. The pieces are also called 'Faris' or 'Kalb' in Tunisian language.</li>

                                        The central square of the board, marked by a cross, is left empty in the setting phase. This square is used for the first move. It is called 'Malha' in Tunisian language meaning it is not seed-able by soldiers.

                                        The Defender follows the Attacker setting their two places following a strategy to capture the Attacker pieces after making captures or to build up zones of safety where unreachable untouchable pieces could demand

                                <p>After completing the setting of the board, players take turn moving soldiers on the board following the following rules:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Soldiers could be used for moving only if they have a free/empty adjacent cell</li>
                                    <li>Moves on the board could be orthogonal in any possible direction (up, down, left, or up) from one cell to another adjacent empty cell </li>
                                    <li>Moves could not be made diagonally or off the board</li>
                                    <li>The first move is always made by the Attacker who must set at least one soldier adjacent to the middle cell (Malha).
                                    </li>
                                    <li> See Figure 3.1. At this point, all board cells are filled up with each player 24 soldiers strategically placed except the middle cell (Malha)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The first move of the Attacker may or may not capture one or more of the defender's soldiers. See <a href="javascript:clickTab('#capturing')">capturing</a> rules in the next tab

                                    </li>

                                        If the first Attacker move (with or without capture) results in the Defender being blocked, the Defender wins the game. The Defender must be allowed to move after the first Attacker move. See Figure 3.4 for an example of this case.

                                    The strategy of the game is not only to capture the opponent soldiers, but also to prevent your own soldiers from being captured. So, sometimes it may be more beneficial to not capture a and move soldiers away to places to gain ground or to prevent being
                                    captured. See Figures 4.1 and 4.2 for examples.

                                <p>Exchanging soldiers is demanded by the Defender who managed to build up protected regions in the board where soldiers could move freely without any risk of capture. These soldiers are called untouchables and demand two
                                    of the Attackers soldiers for one untouchable. Below is the procedure/steps for making an exchange:
                                </p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>The Defender initiates the request by raising the exchange request flag (checking the Exchange request check box) and moving a safe unreachable soldier to use for the exchange.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Attacker could accept or deny the request in his next move by raising or not raising the Exchange Request Accepted flag.

                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The Attacker accepts the request by raising the Exchange Request Accepted flag and moving a free soldier to use in the exchange. This would be the first soldier to use in the exchange
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The Defender accepts this soldier by continuing to raise the exchange request flag (checking the Exchange request check box) and moving the same safe soldier to an adjacent square. If a different soldier is used in the move. The process goes back to the
                                        first step.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Attacker could accept or deny the request in his next move by raising or not raising the Exchange Request Accepted flag and make a move to indicate his second soldier to use for the exchange.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        The Defender accepts this second soldier by continuing to raise the exchange request flag and moving the same soldier to an adjacent soldier. With this step, the exchange request is completed and the exchanged soldiers are removed off the board.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>After the exchange is completed, it is the Attacker's turn to make the next move. </li>
