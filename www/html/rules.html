                                        If the first attacker turn (with or without capture) results in the Defender being blocked, the Defender wins the game.

                                        After the first move and players change turns, any consecutive moves that result in a player being blocked, the player with free soldiers must continue moving until the opponent player is unblocked.

                                    <li>
                                        A capture move may result in the capture of up to three soldiers. See <strong>Figure 4.1.</strong>

                                        The player score is decremented by the number of captured soldiers.

                                    <li>
                                        The player that made the capture is required to continue moving the same soldier to a next adjacent square if a capture is possible until no further capture moves could be made (using the same initial soldier). See <strong>Figures 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5.</strong>
                                    </li>

                                        Soldiers are considered safe in these cases:

                                            <li>
                                                if the soldier is already sandwiched in the original setting of the board.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                    The strategy of the game is not only to capture the opponent soldiers, but also to prevent your own soldiers from being captured. So, sometimes it may be more beneficial to not capture a solider, but move instead to places where to gain ground and prevent
                                    being captured or prevent requests for <a href="javascript:clickTab('#exchanging')">solider exchanges.</a>

                                <p>Exchanging soldiers is demanded by the Defender who managed to build up protected regions in the board where soldiers could move freely without any risk of capture. These soldiers are called untouchables and demand two
                                    of the Attackers soldiers for one untouchable. Below is the procedure/steps for making an exchange:
                                </p>

                                        The Defender initiates the request by raising the exchange request flag (checking the Exchange request check box) and moving a safe unreachable soldier to use for the exchange. See Fig. 5.1

                                        The Attacker could accept or deny the request in his next move by raising or not raising the Exchange Request Accepted flag. The Attacker accepts the request by raising the Exchange Request Accepted flag and moving a free soldier to use in the exchange.
                                        This would be the first soldier to use in the exchange. See Figure 5.2 below.
