Kharbga 

also known by Kharbaga  -- >  a different game see Weekipedia


http://nabataea.net/seega.html


Rules
There are many varieties of Seega, but we are only including instructions for one of the most common, basic games.

A board of 5 x 5 squares is marked out and each player has twelve distinctive 'stones'. Rocks and potsherds work nicely. 
The board may be increased to 7 x 7 or 9 x 9, each player then having twenty-four or forty pieces.

Object of the Game 
Similar to checkers, you are trying to capture your opponent's pieces. The game ends when a player (the looser) has only one piece left.

Start (Optional in Kharga)
To start, the first player lays down two of his or her pieces in the squares marked "X." The other player lays down two pieces
in the squares marked "O."

Next, the players take turns, laying down two pieces at a time in any square but the center square.
These turns are taken until all the pieces are laid down. The center square is left open.

Moving Pieces 
Pieces may be moved only to adjacent open squares, but diagonal moves are not allowed.

Taking Pieces 
A piece is taken (removed from the board) when it is "sandwiched" by two of the opponent's pieces. Sandwiching diagonally does not count. 
"Pieces are only taken when the opponent makes a move that sandwiches the piece. For example, if you move your piece in between two of your
opponent's pieces your piece is safe. If in the original layout of the board, one of your pieces is between two of your opponent's pieces, 
your piece is safe. 

In the diagram, when the red stone is moved as shown, it captures all three blue stones simultaneously.


After making a capture a player can continue to move the same stone as long as it makes further captures.
Safe ground: a player can safely move a stone between two enemy stones and a stone on the central square cannot be captured.
When a player cannot move the opponent must make an entry by taking an extra turn.



The winner: a player wins outright if he can capture all the enemy stones.

Each player may make a barrier behind which there are only his own pieces and these can be moved without fear of attack. The initial placing of the stones is important in planning such a barrier or in preventing the other player from making one. If a barrier is set up, then the player with most stones on the board wins. If they have the same number of stones on the board the game is drawn.




Other Rules 
If a player is completely blocked in so that he or she cannot make any moves, then the blocked-in player is allowed to remove any one of 
the opponent's pieces to clear a path. This situation usually arises only within the first few moves of the game.

A second move in a single turn is allowed if the first move yielded a "take" and an additional move of the same piece will yield another "take."
If a whole series of such moves are possible, then several moves in the same turn are allowed.

FEN for Kharbga  -- 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth–Edwards_Notation

Adapted for Kharbga


Definition[edit]
A FEN "record" defines a particular game position, all in one text line and using only the ASCII character set. 
A text file with only FEN data records should have the file extension ".fen".[1]

A FEN record contains six fields. The separator between fields is a space. The fields are:

- Piece placement (from white's perspective). 
- Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1; 
- within each rank, the contents of each square are described from file "a" through file "g". 
- Following the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is identified by a single letter taken 
- from the standard English names (solider = "S").
- [1] White/Attacker pieces are designated using upper-case letters ("S") or A 
- while black/Defender pieces use lowercase ("s"). Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 7 (the number of empty squares), and "/" separates ranks.

- Active color. "w" means White/Attacker moves next, "b" means Black / Defender.

- 
Castling availability. If neither side can castle, this is "-". Otherwise, this has one or more letters: "K" (White can castle kingside), "Q" (White can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle kingside), and/or "q" (Black can castle queenside).
En passant target square in algebraic notation. If there's no en passant target square, this is "-". If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn. This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture.[2]
Halfmove clock: This is the number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance. This is used to determine if a draw can be claimed under the fifty-move rule.
Fullmove number: The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is incremented after Black's move.
Examples[edit]
Here is the FEN for the starting position:

7/7/7/7/7/7/7  w    -- No pieces on the board
