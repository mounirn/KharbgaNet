Adapted for Kharbga


Definition[edit]
A FEN "record" defines a particular game position, all in one text line and using only the ASCII character set. 
A text file with only FEN data records should have the file extension ".fen".[1]

A FEN record contains six fields. The separator between fields is a space. The fields are:

- Piece placement (from white's perspective). 
- Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1; 
- within each rank, the contents of each square are described from file "a" through file "g". 
- Following the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is identified by a single letter taken 
- from the standard English names (solider = "S").
- [1] White/Attacker pieces are designated using upper-case letters ("S") or A 
- while black/Defender pieces use lowercase ("s"). Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 7 (the number of empty squares), and "/" separates ranks.

- Active color. "w" means White/Attacker moves next, "b" means Black / Defender.

- 
Castling availability. If neither side can castle, this is "-". Otherwise, this has one or more letters: "K" (White can castle kingside), "Q" (White can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle kingside), and/or "q" (Black can castle queenside).
En passant target square in algebraic notation. If there's no en passant target square, this is "-". If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn. This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture.[2]
Halfmove clock: This is the number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance. This is used to determine if a draw can be claimed under the fifty-move rule.
Fullmove number: The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is incremented after Black's move.
Examples[edit]
Here is the FEN for the starting position:

7/7/7/7/7/7/7  w    -- No pieces on the board
